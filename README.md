Hey coders! Got a Node.js tool here that spits out React boilerplate. Perfect for the planners among us. Tweak it, make it yours. Letâ€™s code smarter, not harder! ðŸš€

##HOW TO USE
1.Download the repository to your local machine.
2.Proceed to the project directory.
3.If you have specific components or pages in mind, add their names to the â€˜components_to_generateâ€™ array in the jsxGenerator.js file.
4.Initiate your terminal and execute node jsxGenerator.js.
5.As a result, your React components will be generated in the â€˜./componentsâ€™ directory.

This tool is designed to expedite the initiation of your React projects, allowing you to concentrate on the essential aspect - the creation of remarkable applications.
Continue with your coding endeavors! ðŸš€
